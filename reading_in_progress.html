          <p>The plot takes place in Paris in 1482.</p>
          <p>The novel is divided into 11 books.</p>
          <p>Gr√©goire is a penniless poet. Quasimodo is tried for an attempted kidnapping.
             Esmeralda is arrested for a murder. And she's under the influence of witchcraft.
             The cathedral is obviously a special place in the unfolding of history.</p>
          <p>The novel is too large to be summarized is a few lines. So much that I can only recommend that you read it.</p>
