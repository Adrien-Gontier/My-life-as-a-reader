    <p class="story_of_my_life">My name is Adrien Gontier. I read for years.<br /><br /> <!-- My biography. -->
      I like detective novels, romances, dramas, thrillers, adventures, ...<br/>
      I don't stick to any genre.<br/>
      For writers, I read John Grisham, Dan Brown, Georges Simenon, Stieg Larsson, ...<br/><br/>
      When I read, I really like to listen to the soundtracks of the films and TV series from which the adaptations are taken. It puts me in a certain mood, a certain atmosphere that I like.<br/><br/>
      However, I have a code. I never spoil the plots of the works I read. Because I hate when people do that to me.<br/><br/>
      If I can give you any advice. Only one. For anyone who wants to start reading. It is to begin.</p>
