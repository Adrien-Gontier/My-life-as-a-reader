      <p>My name is Adrien Gontier. I read for years.</p> 
      <p>I like detective novels, romances, dramas, thrillers, adventures, ...</p>
      <p>I don't stick to any genre.</p>
      <p>For writers, I read John Grisham, Dan Brown, Georges Simenon, Stieg Larsson, ...</p>
      <p>When I read, I really like to listen to the soundtracks of the films and TV series from which the adaptations are taken. It puts me in a certain mood, a certain atmosphere that I like.</p>
      <p>However, I have a code. I never spoil the plots of the works I read. Because I hate when people do that to me.</p>
      <p>If I can give you any advice. Only one. For anyone who wants to start reading. It is to begin.</p>
