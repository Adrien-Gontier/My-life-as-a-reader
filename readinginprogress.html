                                The novel is divided into 11 books.<br /><br />
                                Gr√©goire is a penniless poet. Quasimodo is tried for an attempted kidnapping.
                                Esmeralda is arrested for a murder. And she's under the influence of witchcraft.
                                The cathedral is obviously a special place in the unfolding of history.<br /><br />
                                The novel is too large to be summarized is a few lines. So much that I can only recommend that you read it.</p> <!-- Summary of the book. From wikipedia, mostly. -->
